# GitMaster
(WIP) A helper to manage git projects with multiple submodules and their submodules

## Overview

The Git Submodule Manager is a bash script designed to simplify the management of Git projects with multiple submodules, which may also have their own submodules. 
It is 100% in bash which helps for portability.

## Disclamer 
This project is a work in progress, it is subject to many changes at any time.
I'll redo a proper documentation enventually.
